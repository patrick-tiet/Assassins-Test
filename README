Running the backend:

The Android client depends on the backend hosted on EC2. If the server isn't up (http://107.20.135.212:61000/ should return a Django error page), then you may start the server by logging into the EC2 server (assassins/welcome for username/password) and going to ~/myproject then running the command: "python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:61000".


Running the Android code:

We have provided an .apk file necessary to run the application. 
Follow the guide to get the Android SDK and emulator set up at:

To install the .apk file on emulator, you can either email the file to yourself and download from the emulated phone or you can try:
